# Introduction
This project is from Microcessor Design class at the University of Seoul.
Light with convenient features.
Developed with ATMega128
1. Light detection: Light is automatically on at night.
2. Double clap detection: Toggle light with double clap. With this feature, we can control the light remotely.
